# How do people use Citibike?
#### An exploratory data analysis and visualization project

Collaborators: Redouane Dziri, Corentin LLorca, Arnaud Stiegler

This repository contains a project mostly carried out in R to find behavioral patterns and trends in the use of CitiBike in New York City. 

The file `report.Rmd` contains the bulk of the outputs and results of our analysis as well as explanations on which data was used, how it was gathered, what preliminary steps were taken to prepare it for exploration, an executive summary and the link to an interactive component of the analysis.

The folders `geographical_study`, `seasonal_patterns`, `user_behavior` and `weather_effects` contain parts of the analysis and visualization pertaining to particular aspects of the study and can be read independently from each other.
