## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r comment=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(sp)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)

colnames(concise_trips)[5] <- 'end_station_id'
concise_trips <- subset(concise_trips, select=-c(starttime,stoptime,bikeid,gender))
concise_trips <- concise_trips[concise_trips$usertype=='Subscriber']
stations_info <- read_csv("../stations_info.csv")
colnames(stations_info)[1] = 'start_station_id'
concise_trips_merged <- merge(x = concise_trips, y = stations_info, by = 'start_station_id')

colnames(stations_info)[1] = 'end_station_id'

# 1) Most active stations

First of all, we can visualize the stations that are the most 'active': those are the stations that have the highest traffic of citibikes (in terms of start and end for each station).
